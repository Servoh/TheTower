<details><summary>Creating an issue</summary>
<p>
 There are some reasons why you could create an issue for things like bug reports, feature requests, etc. So here are the steps to creating one.

### 1. Create an issue from a template
  Go to the issues page, click new issue, and then select the template for the issue you want (i.e. bug report, feature request, etc).

### 2. Fill out the information
  The template should have it formatted, all you have to do is fill it in or replace things with the info you need to put down.

#### Note:
If it gets bad, we might make it so issues will have to be 'approved', essentially one of us will have to pass it off before the team starts working on it. If you see invalid on your issue, check the comments to see what we said to fix, or create a new issue with the fixes in it. If you see https://github.com/Servoh/TheTower/labels/pending on it, then it is still waiting for us to pass it off.

##Invalid issues
When we look through issues, we might mark it with the https://github.com/Servoh/TheTower/labels/invalid label, which indicates that the issue isn't formatted right, or is missing important info. When this happens, we will leave a comment after marking it saying what needs to be fixed. Once we see that it is fixed, we will unmark it and resume work on it once we get to it. If it isn't that important, and you don't fix it within a few weeks, we will just close the issue without fixing it during our issue purging periods.
